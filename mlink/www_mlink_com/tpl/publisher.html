            <h4>Defining a Publisher</h4>
            <p>At Brandreward, we define a publisher as a digital influencer or a digital content provider with a clear purpose. The term “publisher” covers a large array of digital blogs, websites, forums, platforms, mobile apps, web apps, content networks, ecommerce sites, media websites or other sites with published content that might be looking for an exciting new, more optimized or customized way to earn money from their quality content. If you are unsure if you fit our definition of a potential publisher, then just ask us through the contact form <a href="<{$smarty.const.BASE_URL}>/contactUs.php">here</a>.</p>
